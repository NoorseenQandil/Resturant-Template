## Hints
#### - Section1: Home
  - Consists of 2 parts: The first part includes resturant logo image and navbar links. The second one includes main caption that consists of logo image, caption and two buttons.
  - Use Float property and set left to its value to put the logo image in navbar on the left side.
    ```
      #home .navbar img{
       float: left;
      }
    ```
  - Use Float property and set right to value to put the navbar links on the right side.
  - Use list-style property and set none to its value to remove the list style put by default.
    ```
      #home .navbar ul{
        float: right;
        list-style: none;
     }
    ```
  - Its important to use clear with float.
  - Use text-align property and set center to its value to put the caption content in the center.
  - Use grouping to make the two buttons the same padding and border values.

#### - Section2: About
 - Consists of 2 sides: The left side includes chef image. The right one includes short paragraph about us and one button.
 - Use span tag in HTML to make difference between the words in title. Then put different color for it in CSS code.
   ```
     <h2><span>Our</span>Stor</h2>
   ```
   ```
     #about .about-info h2 span{
       color: #09c;
     }
   ```
   
#### - Section3: LightBox
 - This section consists of one image in background.
 - Use background-attachment property and set fixed to its value to make it scroll when scroll page.
 - Set fixed height value for this section.
   ```
     #light-box{
        background-image: url("../images/bg-home.jpg");
        background-attachment: fixed;
        height: 500px;
      }
   ```
   
 #### - Section4: Meals
  - This section consists of four parts.
  - Each one includes one image, title and paragraph for description.
  - Put the width of each section is 25%.
  - Use Float property to put the four parts on the same line.
  - Use Clear property with float.
  - To make each image in circle shape, Use border-raduis property and set its value to 50%.
    ```
     #meals .meal{
        width: 25%;
        text-align: center;
        float: left;
    }
      #meals .meal img{
          border-radius: 50%;
      }
    ```
  - To seperate by line between the title and description, you can make empty div tag and set width, height and backgroud-color values for it.
    ```
      #meals .meal .brbr{
      height: 3px;
      background-color: #09c;
      margin: 15px auto;
      width: 100px;
     }
    ```
